# 1) Take a user's local events, then split them out to attending and upcomming

# 2) Check the event_rsvp if it has a calendar_event_id associated with it.
# -- if it doesnt
#   Create a calendar entry

# -- otherwise
#   Check if the calendar exists on both the primary and upcoming calendars.

#   If the calendar exists on the appropriate calendar, leave it be.
#   If the calendar has switched to a different calendar, update the status of the event and inform the event provider.
#   If the calendar doesn't exist on either calendaar, recreate it (and update
#   the calendar_event_id)
